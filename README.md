PeaceTech Labâ€™s series of hate speech Lexicons identify and explain inflammatory language on social media while offering alternative words and phrases that can be used to combat the spread of hate speech in conflict-affected countries. Our Lexicons serve as a pivotal resource for local peacebuilders, social media companies, and organizations working to stop and prevent hate speech worldwide.

This project aims at harnessing the power of textual analysis for developing a lexicon of hate terms used colloquially in Ethiopia. The analysis is being conducted on survey data collected via KoboToolBox using Python libraries (pandas, numpy).
